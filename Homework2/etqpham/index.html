        These are my 3 data visualizations on the dataset concluding Data Science Salaries from 2020-2023.
        I chose a bar chart for my first visualization, emphasizing the difference in salaries between each level
        of experience. I then assembled them in increasing order to show how salary, on average, increases as your 
        experience level increases as well. My second chart, the pie chart, is simple and shows the differnece in average
        salaries by company size. You can tell that you make the most money, on average, working at a medium-sized company
        and the least money at a small company, probably referring to start-ups. Lastly, my advanced diagram is a Sankey diagram
        that shows a flow of change, starting from experience level, then the user chooses a job title that has been summarized in 
        categories of similarity, and then showing how many of those filtered workers work in a small, medium, or large-sized company.
        This diagram is more of a comparison of ratio or count, as opposed to the other 2 diagrams that show salary based on a factor. 
        Overall, I wanted to show what paths are popular in the field, and factors for salary. *CHATGPT USED FOR SYNTAX/FUNCTION HELP*
